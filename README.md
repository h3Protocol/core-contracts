![H3rmes Logo](https://placehold.co/600x200?text=H3rmes+Finance)

H3rmes Finance is a next-generation DeFi protocol built on Sonic that combines rising price-floor tokenomics with borrowing, lending, and staking mechanisms, all backed by oSonic.

## Protocol Overview

H3rmes introduces an innovative financial ecosystem with several interconnected components:

- **H3RMES Token**: Core asset with mathematically-enforced rising price backed by oSonic
- **XH3RMES Token**: Governance and staking token with vesting mechanisms
- **Borrowing System**: Collateralized loans using H3RMES as backing
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Rewards for providing liquidity via XH3RMES emissions
- **Advanced Trading**: Leverage trading and flash-close position functionality

## Contract Addresses

All protocol contracts are deployed using our deterministic CREATE3 deployer, ensuring consistent addresses across all deployments:

## Core Mechanisms

### Price Floor Tokenomics

H3RMES implements a mathematically guaranteed rising price floor through several key mechanisms:

1. **Bonding Curve**: Every buy/sell transaction occurs along a deterministic curve
2. **Backing Pool**: All purchases add to the oSonic backing pool
3. **Safety Check**: Transactions that would lower the token price are rejected
4. **Dead Shares**: Initial 1 token permanently locked in contract

Price calculations follow these formulas:
